# Team Website Generator

  The Team Website Generator uses nodejs and javascript to collect data and generate a website respectively. The user enters their data and is then presented with options to add teammates (engineers or interns) or to finalize the product and generate a website. The website when generated shows all your teammate's info, as well as your own.

  The only new technologies used were objects, which stored the imformation for each teammate type, and jest testing. The objects worked fine, and the website can support as many memebers as you're willing to add. The testing however, doesn't work, but the functionallity is implemented, I just haven't tested it yet.
